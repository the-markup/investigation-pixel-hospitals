# Pixel Hunt: Hospital Websites

This repository contains screenshots and HAR files supporting our article ["Facebook Is Receiving Sensitive Medical Information from Hospital Websites."](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites) This article was copublished with STAT and is available on its site as well.

There is a folder for each hospital and health system website we examined. Inside each folder are screenshots of sensitive data being sent to Facebook (when such transfers took place) and HAR files saved during the process of documenting the data collection.
